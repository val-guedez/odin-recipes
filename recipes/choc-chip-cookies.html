    <p> Follow the recipe below to eat cookies like the ones above :D </p>

    <p>
        I have personally used this recipe to replicate the cookies you can get at subway (the yummy, chewy style),
        so if you like that style of cookie keep on reading!
    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 stick softened salt butter</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup light brown sugar </li>
        <li> 1/3 cup granulated sugar </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 1 egg</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups plain all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups semi sweet choc chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF/175ºC.</li>
        <li>Put the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar into the bowl of your stand mixer. Beat them together for 3-4 minutes until the mixture is light.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla extract and egg, then beat slowly until everything is creamy and even lighter in color. (Around 3 minutes)</li>
        <li>Add in the flour, salt, and baking soda, then mix until the flour is almost combined.</li>
        <li>Tip the chocolate chips into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Then mix until everything is combined. Don't overmix.</li>
        <li>Roll golf ball-sized balls of dough and place them onto a baking sheet lined with cooking paper. Ensure they are 2”/5cm apart</li>
        <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes until lightly golden. (They will be soft when you take them from the oven!)</li>
        <li>Bang the baking sheet on the countertop to flatten the cookies; use a metal spoon to lightly flatten them further.</li>
        <li>Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the cookies to a cooling rack and leave to cool.</li>
    </ol>
